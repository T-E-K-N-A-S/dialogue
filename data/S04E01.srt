1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,792
Troy and Abed back from summer.

2
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:08,964
Wait a minute.
Something's changed.

3
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:10,843
Oh, there's 12 additional
thumb tacks on that board.

4
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:11,855
They're driving me crazy.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,933
No, I meant this.
Trying out the hipster look.

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,311
It's cool, but also not.

7
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:20,901
Hey, guys, have a good summer?

8
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:22,634
Take them off.

9
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:26,247
Happy first day of school.

10
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:27,819
Oh.

11
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:30,310
Good morning.
I brought brownies.

12
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:32,938
Oh.

13
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:37,003
Congratulations, it's me.

14
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:41,219
Huh, I see we've all reinvented
ourselves over the summer.

15
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:43,102
A little late
to the hipster party much?

16
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:45,040
A little much on the much much?

17
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,520
We should get to class?
Where's Pierce?

18
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:50,386
- I don't know.
- Hey-o!

19
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,601
Sorry, I'm late.

20
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:55,974
Damn Mexican cleaning woman
did a cha-cha

21
00:00:55,993 --> 00:00:58,758
on my glasses,
so I got to wear this old pair.

22
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,656
Abed.
Abed.

23
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:06,860
- Abed.
- Yup.

24
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:07,960
Did you go to your happy place?

25
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:09,025
- Yeah.
- Did you envision

26
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,070
a babbling brook
like I described?

27
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:12,254
I started out
with a babbling brook,

28
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:13,904
but then I layered in elements
from our world.

29
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:15,669
I'm sure fans of the babbling
brook will complain,

30
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:16,932
but I thought
that was limiting.

31
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:18,367
Well, it's best
to keep it simple.

32
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,923
- It was a babbling brook.
- Okay.

33
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,620
Here's the deal, Jessica Biel.

34
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,766
The first day of senior year
is emotional for everyone,

35
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:26,979
so I hereby therapize you to go

36
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:30,017
to your happy place
whenever you feel stressed.

37
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:33,495
- I found my lucky notebook.
- Found my lucky charm.

38
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:37,127
Abed, you ready for our last
first day of school?

39
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,307
Are you ready, buddy?

40
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,716
I just need a minute.

<i>before a live audience

53
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:18,202
I can't believe we're finally
getting into this class.

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,993
I can't believe there's a class called
"The History of Ice Cream."

55
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,370
Seniors!

56
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,110
There they are.

57
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,250
- Seniors!
- Oh, speaking of seniors,

58
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,631
I've decided I'm going
to do senioritis this year.

59
00:02:33,657 --> 00:02:36,621
You know, just hangin' out
and blowin' off classes,

60
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:39,269
pullin' pranks,
not sayin' my "G" s.

61
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:41,734
Ooh, I'll pull
some pranks with you.

62
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:44,085
Okay.
Or Jeff or whoever.

63
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:45,416
You know, whoever's around.
Whatever.

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,074
So, Abed, after class,
we're still doing

65
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:49,014
our first-day-of-school tradition, right?
- You know it.

66
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,345
We like to make wishes
in the fountain.

67
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,200
- Ohh!
- Fellas, I hate to tell you,

68
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:53,652
wishes aren't real.

69
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:56,407
If you want something bad,
you have to work for it.

70
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:57,703
Or use a spell.

71
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:58,983
All of our wishes come true.

72
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:01,799
Last year, Troy wished we got
Bin Laden and the Dorito Taco.

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,608
Yeah, but Obama got credit
for both.

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,740
Could you wish for Jeff
to be on time for once?

75
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:08,111
No. No wasting wishes
on impossibilities.

76
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,728
We have to make
this year count,

77
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:11,050
especially
since it's the last one.

78
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,220
Oh, no, is all this
for "The History of Ice Cream"?

79
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:18,570
They overbooked it, so it's
first come, first serve now.

80
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,030
Oh, just like real ice cream.

81
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,914
- Guys, over here!
- Oh, Jeffrey.

82
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:29,078
Jeff, I can't believe
that you came early.

83
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:30,480
Don't you read
Gary's twitter feed?

84
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:32,189
He posted a crisis alert
about it.

85
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:33,592
I came early to save seats.

86
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:36,792
Oh, you know what, girls,
I gave you the old flyer.

87
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,345
"Instagram for besties"
is in room 44.

88
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,417
Showing up early,
helping others,

89
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,027
sending girls away?

90
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,245
Could this be
a whole new Jeff Winger?

91
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:48,067
Don't ruin it by approving it.

92
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,387
Oh, so that's progressed.

93
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:55,936
I mean, it's progressed,

94
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,866
but it hasn't
progressed-progressed.

95
00:03:57,899 --> 00:03:58,930
It's progressive.

96
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,993
- Good luck, Troy.
- Hey!

97
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,932
You can't just walk in here!

98
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,114
I've been pissing in jars
for an hour

99
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,495
trying to keep this seat.

100
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,930
- Oh.
- Too bad, Leonard.

101
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:09,785
All right, all right.

102
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,152
All right.
Simmer Dean.

103
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:14,284
This can't be good.
He's dressed as himself.

104
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:17,703
Apparently Greendale's registration
system has been hacked.

105
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,051
That's right.
Someone hacked

106
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,133
into the supply closet
and counterfeited

107
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:24,455
these "History of Ice Cream"
admission cards.

108
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:28,013
Whoever did this is very good.

109
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,756
There is only one fair way
to solve this.

110
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:35,138
So follow me to...

111
00:04:57,743 --> 00:05:01,068
The Hunger Deans!

112
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:02,833
Thank you.
Thank you.

113
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:05,116
There are 35 tests of strength

114
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:06,141
and agility.

115
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,792
The winner of each one
of these contests

116
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,343
will be awarded
a red rubber ball.

117
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,457
No ball, no ice cream.

118
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:15,948
And these are impossible
to counterfeit

119
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:20,345
because each one has been marked
by my distinct bite print.

120
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,446
- Oh, lord, no.
- Yes.

121
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,083
Guys, we need
to take this class.

122
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:25,989
It's the only History credit
this semester.

123
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,344
Whatevs.
We'll take it next semes.

124
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:29,932
Ter.
Semester.

125
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:31,745
But I need it now.

126
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:34,764
Okay, I took
some extra classes online,

127
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,677
and I'm one history credit away
from graduating.

128
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:39,414
Jeff, you're graduating early?

129
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:42,287
Well, graduating after 30
can't be characterized as early.

130
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:44,792
- When were you gonna tell us, Jeff?
- I was working on a speech.

131
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:47,476
And, believe me, it tied in
a lot of things.

132
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:49,992
There was a lot of resolutions
and epiphanies.

133
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,798
And it would have gone down
a lot better

134
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:54,239
after we had taken
the ice cream class together.

135
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,731
So that's why you were holding
our seats?

136
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:57,165
For your own selfish reasons?

137
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,233
No, I want us
to take the class together.

138
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,472
I just want it to be
the last class we take together.

139
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:03,256
I probably should have phrased

140
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,999
- that differently.
- Fine. Win your red ball.

141
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:07,622
What do I care?
I've got a senior prank to pull.

142
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:08,806
- Shirley.
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,334
So, Abed, ready
to make some wishes?

144
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:12,630
Make chocolate hot dogs
a reality?

145
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:13,820
Actually, why don't you go
with Britta?

146
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,182
I think I'll just hang out here
and watch.

147
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,533
Really?
Are you sure?

148
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,552
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- F-i-n-e or f-y-n-e?

149
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,580
We made one of 'em a code
for "not fine."

150
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:24,512
- Oh.
- F-y-n-e.

151
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:26,343
Okay, he's fine.
Let's go.

152
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,418
- See you around, old Jeff.
- No.

153
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:31,297
New Jeff. New Jeff does not
just look out for himself.

154
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,306
New Jeff is gonna win
seven red balls

155
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:35,128
because he is not gonna take
that class

156
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,834
unless you guys are with me.

157
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,813
Look, we're gonna have
to leave this place sometime.

158
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,868
Like an ice cream cone melting

159
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:45,295
in the sun, our time here
can't last forever.

160
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:47,734
That was part of the speech
I was writing!

161
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,307
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

162
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:53,420
Oh, just making plans
for the future.

163
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,001
Can't stay
at Greendale forever.

164
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:57,506
Hey, is mine different
than yours?

165
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,865
Look out below.

166
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:04,441
Coming in for a land-Dean.

167
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:07,727
Amelia Earhart?

168
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:10,367
Close.
I am America's sexiest aviator,

169
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:12,371
Leo DiCaprio.

170
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:15,412
And, just as his character
lost his mind,

171
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:18,518
so have I lost
your student records.

172
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:21,114
What?
I can't believe it.

173
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,942
Yeah, Amelia Earhart
would have been faster.

174
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,066
As you know,
our student records are stored

175
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:30,202
on a Microsoft Paint file,
which I was assured

176
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:31,976
was future-proof.

177
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,083
Meanwhile,
our extended warranty

178
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,919
is not being honored by the restaurant
that used to be Circuit City.

179
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:41,892
But I think the fairest way
to handle this

180
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:45,083
is to have everyone repeat
the last three years.

181
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:46,748
You can't be serious.

182
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,915
In-Dean, I am.

183
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,136
I'm gonna be here forever.

184
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,927
Forever.
Forever. Forever.

185
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:58,903
I'm gonna stay in here forever.

186
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:06,706
Gentlemen... and ladies.

187
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,408
My first red ball

188
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,247
is way up high.

189
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:12,095
To touch my ball,

190
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,479
first touch the sky.

191
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:16,034
Go!

192
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,335
Give it up, Leonard.

193
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:21,395
I'm gonna eat
your ice cream, Winger.

194
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,306
Agh!
You? You're pre-med!

195
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:25,784
- I want ice cream.
- Yeah, well, I want

196
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,654
to graduate with dignity.

197
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:29,144
Not cool!

198
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:34,274
Jeff's really going
after that ball.

199
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:37,035
There's got to be a joke
in there somewhere.

200
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:38,517
That's my first ball.

201
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:40,274
New Jeff!

202
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:43,200
Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.

203
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,183
No.

204
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:50,920
You know, if we're doing the
first three years over again,

205
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:52,208
I could change majors.

206
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,654
I've always been curious
about Forensics.

207
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,576
Hey, did you know
you could major in Antics?

208
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,331
I checked.
You need a tomfoolery pre-req,

209
00:08:58,362 --> 00:08:59,912
but they waive it for women.

210
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,290
This is lunacy.

211
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:04,056
We are not gonna start over
as freshmen.

212
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,032
Hey, there's
a freshman mixer tonight.

213
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:07,188
Are you guys freshmen?

214
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,541
We can be.

215
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,958
This prank is amazing.

216
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,394
He's gonna come in here later
and have the creepy feeling

217
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:28,240
someone was in here.

218
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,531
We should go
before we get caught.

219
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,381
Well, aren't we gonna do
something now that we're here?

220
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,105
Do something?

221
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:35,243
All right.

222
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:37,847
A prank on a prank.

223
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,808
Let's move everything
on his desk over an inch

224
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,196
except his stapler.

225
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,820
Then he'll think
we moved his stapler.

226
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,452
Oh, my God, there's
so many levels to this.

227
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,618
How about we fill his car
with popcorn?

228
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:49,328
That sounds messy.

229
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:52,754
That sounds messy!

230
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,611
Okay, keys.
Keys.

231
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:57,976
Okay, I'm the Dean.

232
00:09:58,396 --> 00:09:59,479
I come into my office,

233
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:00,552
turn on the light.

234
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,835
"Oh, my, did my stapler
grow legs and move?"

235
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:07,076
Then come over here for coffee.

236
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:10,622
I would hide my keys

237
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:15,384
in...
Huh.

238
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:17,096
Oh.

239
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:23,220
- Heels.
- Oh, you got skills.

240
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:24,842
Oh.

241
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:27,255
- Look who got his ball.
- Not my ball.

242
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,105
Your ball.

243
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:29,393
I just wanted you guys
to see it.

244
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,763
- New Jeff.
- Jeffrey, is that blood on your shirt?

245
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,034
Oh, no, it's cool.
It's Leonard's.

246
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:34,646
Oh.
Oh.

247
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,438
Two balls!

248
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,039
This is gonna be so good
when I finally get it.

249
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:46,365
It's a little weird
doing this without Abed.

250
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:48,008
Come on.
It'll be fun.

251
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:50,136
I'll put my...
my Britta twist on it.

252
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,556
I got skills.
I got skills.

253
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:56,517
- Sorry.
- Let's get this started.

254
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:57,792
We always do
the first one together.

255
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,573
One, two, three.

256
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:01,371
- I wish for a great school year.
- I wish for 1,000 wishes.

257
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:03,040
Great school year?

258
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:04,909
The first wish
is always for 1,000 wishes.

259
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,230
But we have all these coins.

260
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:08,238
Yeah, but the coins
aren't the wishes.

261
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,781
Oh, I didn't know that.

262
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:13,807
I wish for Britta to have 499
of my remaining wishes.

263
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,417
Thank you.

264
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:17,268
I wish to end all wars.

265
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:18,342
That's another rule.

266
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,267
No wishes
containing the word "all."

267
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:21,949
Guaranteed ironic consequences.

268
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:23,892
I don't think
anyone's gonna miss wars.

269
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:25,737
Uhm, <i>Star Wars, Thumb Wars,</i>

270
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:27,762
<i>wow, Storage Wars!</i>

271
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,402
Fine.

272
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:30,879
You can't get in the fountain.

273
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:32,771
- I'm taking that penny back.
- I already told you,

274
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:33,919
the pennies aren't wishes.

275
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,364
You can't flip a wish.

276
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:37,866
- That's ridiculous.
- Your rules are ridiculous.

277
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:39,578
They're Abed's rules.

278
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:41,477
And they're awesome,
and they always work.

279
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,107
Well, Abed's not here, so...

280
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:45,640
Unwish!

281
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,643
- You can't do that.
- I just did.

282
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:49,401
- Unwish!
- No! Rewish.

283
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:51,876
- Ununwish.
- Give me it! Unwish!

284
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,667
No!

285
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,350
No!
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,856
What... you're helping me!

287
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,939
You're helping.
I like it.

288
00:11:59,221 --> 00:12:01,203
- Unwish! Unwish!
- Oh, God!

289
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:02,741
Why does this feel good?

290
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:05,141
Stupid, selfish Jeff

291
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,573
coming here,
ruining our senior year.

292
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:09,784
Ah, great!
My "G" s are back.

293
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,467
Yes, it's crummy
that Jeff is leaving early,

294
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:13,200
but we're all graduating
eventually.

295
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:14,408
But why the rush?

296
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:17,234
What, so Jeff can run off
and be a gross lawyer again?

297
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,950
Troy and Abed
start drinking coffee?

298
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:21,536
I become
a boring hospital administrator?

299
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:23,836
- Who wants to do that?
- You do. Right?

300
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,285
Yay, hospital administration!

301
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:28,004
Can't wait to be buried alive

302
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:29,985
under a pile of paperwork
and bed pans,

303
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:32,572
just trying to summon the
courage to ask out Dr. Patel,

304
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:35,541
the gorgeous Indian neurosurgeon
who doesn't even know I exist.

305
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,178
This isn't a conversation,
is it?

306
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:40,581
Whoo-hoo! The sad, slow march
toward death begins.

307
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:44,712
Senioritis!

308
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:47,453
Ready, set...

309
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,203
Third ball.

310
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,277
Fourth ball.

311
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,821
Well, well, well.

312
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:15,979
Looks like someone wants
to be a hero.

313
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:18,010
A big man.
A huge, throbbing, sweaty...

314
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:20,512
Dean, I just want to get my history
credit and get out of here.

315
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:22,731
And I just need to know
how bad you want it.

316
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:25,107
The next competition
will be particularly difficult

317
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:27,561
for some of you
because... lt requires

318
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:29,525
complete emotional commitment.

319
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,106
The Tango.

320
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,248
I will be the judge.

321
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:33,401
There can only be one winner,

322
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:35,016
so choose your partners wisely.

323
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:36,253
Come on, Winger.

324
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:37,569
It's water
under the bridge, right?

325
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,837
- Partners?
- Sorry.

326
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:40,079
My dance card's full.

327
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:43,491
For my partner
in the Tango competition,

328
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:45,525
I choose...

329
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:46,851
The Dean.

330
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:49,926
The fountain works.

331
00:13:57,857 --> 00:13:59,241
All these balls.

332
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:02,320
I'm so close, I can taste it.

333
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:09,279
Pierce, only you could turn
a freshman mixer

334
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:10,536
into a disaster.

335
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:12,918
I was this close
to getting those two girls.

336
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:15,154
Jeff, look how close you're
holding your fingers together.

337
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,759
That's your penis.

338
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:19,700
Guys, great news.

339
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:21,423
After just one Forensics class,

340
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,682
I found a way
to retrieve our student records.

341
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,279
It turns out there's a backup.

342
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:26,472
And it's in this safe.

343
00:14:33,593 --> 00:14:34,793
I have a theory, Dean.

344
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:36,217
Do tell.

345
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,367
I don't think
you want me to graduate.

346
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:40,594
Don't be absurd, Jeffrey.

347
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:43,087
I want success
for all Greendale students.

348
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,173
Oh, really?
Then answer me this.

349
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:47,406
What happened
to the other History class?

350
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:50,026
What other History class?

351
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:51,732
The second History class,

352
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,513
the one
that actually taught History,

353
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:55,557
that disappeared
from the schedule

354
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,397
after I took summer classes.

355
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:59,441
Oh, you're telling yourself
a fantasy.

356
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:02,135
Who really made those
counterfeited ice cream tickets?

357
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:04,662
Who's so good
that they got your handwriting

358
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:06,823
with its hearts and flourishes?

359
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,599
Oh, God, you're right.

360
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,111
I can't let you go, Jeffrey.

361
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:11,495
You weren't supposed
to compete.

362
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,878
You were supposed to walk away
with the rest of the study group.

363
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:16,560
You can't not get rid of me
that easily.

364
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:19,967
Oh, God, why'd I make it
feats of strength and grace?

365
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:23,495
It's as if I wanted you to win.

366
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,448
But that can't be true.

367
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:29,824
Smile.

368
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,241
Best friends!

369
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:40,428
Let's hug it out.
Okay.

370
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,646
Here.
One more ball to go.

371
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,589
But it's another dance contest,
so I think I got it.

372
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,110
What's wrong with Abed?

373
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:55,865
No, no, no, no,
don't open the safe.

374
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:57,173
We're redoing
our first three years.

375
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,249
- That's what I want.
- It's okay, Abed.

376
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:01,772
Here's a trick I use
when I feel overwhelmed.

377
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:03,851
Just imagine a happy place

378
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:05,862
and then go there.

379
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:11,956

380
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:14,332

<i>Greendale babies

385
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:31,198
Pierce, what did you do
to Abed?

386
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,059
Gay balls!

387
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:34,730
Nailed it.

388
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,229
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.

389
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:41,060
Poor Abed. Is he
in his imagination emporium?

390
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,683
Dreamatorium. No, this seems
like something new.

391
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:47,420
Abed was having some anxiety
about all the changes this year,

392
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:51,034
so I may have told him to go
to a happy place in his mind.

393
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:53,903
You told him to go somewhere
in his mind?

394
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,528
Do you realize
who you told that to?

395
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,607
The last competition
to win a red ball

396
00:16:57,638 --> 00:16:59,151
begins in one minute.

397
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:00,691
Honestly, Jeff, you can go.

398
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,928
No one will think
you're selfish.

399
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:04,948
This looks bad.

400
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,968
I wish I hadn't broken Abed.

401
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,889
There is one thing
we could try.

402
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,755
Oh, okay.

403
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:21,622
Hey, let's play Pretend.

404
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,277
Yeah, we could be cowboys.

405
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:24,745
We could be spacemen.

406
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,066
That's right, baby Pierce.
We can play forever.

407
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,419
- It's not working.
- What's not working?

408
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:37,996
Okay, contestants, final
competition begins right now.

409
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:41,418
God, I hate new Jeff.

410
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:45,236
Hey, guys,
I have something to say.

411
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:47,148
Yay!
Like always!

412
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,230
I was just outside Babyville.

413
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,824
There's nothing
outside Babyville.

414
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:52,756
You know what, there is!

415
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,505
And it was scary,

416
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:56,892
because change is always scary.

417
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:58,992
But then I thought of you guys,

418
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,948
and I wasn't so scared.

419
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:02,764
Abed, when you brought
this group together,

420
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,259
you changed our lives,
but then we changed each other.

421
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:08,620
And we're gonna keep changing
in unexpected ways.

422
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,639
And we're still gonna be
friends,

423
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,018
even if we don't all become
professors at Greendale

424
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:14,988
or open a restaurant together

425
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:17,652
or move into the same apartment
building after Pierce dies.

426
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,157
Even if we go somewhere,

427
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:23,606
we're not going anywhere.

428
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:25,345
Aww.

429
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,112
That was a killer speech, Jeff.

430
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:38,920
- Oh.
- I didn't say anything.

431
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:40,289
I literally just walked up.

432
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,615
I know.
I made the speech for you.

433
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:42,897
It hit all the right notes.

434
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:44,882
I was trying to hang on to this
moment because I was so afraid

435
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,385
of the future,
but then I realized

436
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,478
all of this
was once the future.

437
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,712
And it was completely different
from what I'd known before.

438
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:52,272
And it was happening so fast,

439
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:54,410
but in the end,
or in the now, I guess,

440
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:55,610
it turned out great.

441
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:57,293
And just like ice cream,

442
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,088
we've melted together
and made a new...

443
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:00,844
I just had to run the scenario
to figure it out.

444
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:01,736
Oh.

445
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:02,928
Sorry I missed the fountain.

446
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:03,892
It's okay.

447
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:05,390
Britta introduced a new rule...

448
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:06,839
no rules.

449
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:08,340
Cool.
We can discuss it.

450
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:09,570
When they were incepting,

451
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,653
I got their balls.

452
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:17,052
Well, now that we're out
of History of Ice Cream,

453
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:19,706
I can finally take
"Advanced Claims Denial."

454
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:21,936
You should take "Forensics."

455
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,708
Can somebody tell me
what the hell we just did?

456
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,708
Jeffrey.

457
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:32,453
- Jeffrey, wait.
- Dean, what are you...

458
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:34,748
Oh! You smell like the floor
of a movie theater.

459
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:36,281
Yeah,
but not for the usual reasons.

460
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:38,106
I have had the worst day.

461
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,479
Our dance photo
didn't come out,

462
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:41,182
someone moved my stapler,

463
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:43,707
and, worst of all, I hurt you.

464
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:44,822
But you'll be happy to know

465
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:47,335
that we'll be offering
another History class,

466
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:49,016
because I care about you.

467
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,818
And not because I found out
if we don't offer

468
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:53,788
a real History class we'll lose,
like, $40,000 in grant money.

469
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:55,004
Thank you, Dean.

470
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,507
By the way, you didn't have
to come all this way

471
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,927
- to tell me that.
- Oh, no, it wasn't a problem.

472
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:00,767
It's on my way.

473
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,434
Please tell me
you're breaking into that condo.

474
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,087
No, I bought it.

475
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:08,215
Now we'll be
like almost roomies.

476
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:11,098
<i>Oh, good, you got wine.
I've got friends with benefits.</i>

477
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:12,095
No subtext.

478
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,806
I don't know why I was
so worried about change.

479
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:16,432
This year's gonna be great.

480
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:18,214
I'll be right over.

481
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:50,958
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

482
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:52,672
Guaranteed to work.
It's an antic.

483
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:56,330
Ahh!
Not so fast, you two.

484
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,641
- Get ready to run.
- In these heels?

485
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,645
Where'd you girls
get those dresses?

486
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:02,895
They're fabulous.

487
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:04,871
- Mm.
- They're charming.

488
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,352
Oh!

489
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,196
Not so fast, mister.

490
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:10,808
- Excuse you?
- Excuse me. Thank you, sir.

491
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,894
- Not for you.
- Hello, it's Britta.

492
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,460
Okay, I know a man
when I see one.

493
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:16,618
Oh, lord, no!
